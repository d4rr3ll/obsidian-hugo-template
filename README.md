# Obsidian Hugo Template

A template Hugo repo with a `Makefile` to make converting an Obsidian Vault simple.

Produced as supporting material for [this blog post](https://www.darrelltaylor.com/article/blog-build/)

## Quickstart

Ensure you have `hugo` and `curl` installed, checkout the repo and run:
```shell
git submodule update
make server
```
This will build the contents of the Obsidian Vault that resides in the `vault` directory and spin up the local hugo server
